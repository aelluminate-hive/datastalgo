# Count Vowels

###### General instructions for all prelim exams can be found [here](../prelim.md).

## Problem Statement

Write a Python function `count_vowels(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the total number of vowels in the string. The vowels to consider are `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u` (both lowercase and uppercase).

Example:

> Input: `'Hello, World!'`  
> Output: `3` (because `e`, `o`, and `o` are vowels)

> Input: `'Python Programming'`  
> Output: `4` (because `o`, `o`, `a`, and `i` are vowels)

> Input: `'AEIOU'`  
> Output: `5` (all characters are vowels)


## Instructions

1. Implement the function `count_vowels(s)` in the file `solution.py`.
2. Do not use any external libraries or advanced Python features (e.g., list comprehensions, lambda functions, etc.).
3. Use only the following Python concepts:
   - Variables and Data Types
   - Conditionals
   - Loops
   - Type Casting
4. Test your solution by running `test.py`. The script will automatically check your implementation against 10 test cases.

## Hints

1. Loop through each character in the string.
2. Use a conditional statement to check if the character is a vowel (both lowercase and uppercase).
3. Use a conditional statement to check if the character is a vowel (both lowercase and uppercase).
